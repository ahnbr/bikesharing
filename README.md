# NYC Citi Bike Sharing

## Overview of the Project

In this project, we were tasked with analyzing the bike sharing data in NYC to provide recommendations for a similar program in Des Moines. We utilized Tableau to create visual components to accompany our analysis. 

## Results

* For starters, we wanted to see how many total useres there were during our desired timeframe, which was for the month of August, 2019. This total was 2,344,224 total users. Wow! That is a lot of bikers!

* The next thing we wanted to look at was the duration of time that people would be renting bikes. From our analysis of the data, the number of hours that bikes were rented for really peaked between 4-6 hours, with 5 being the higest duration.

* Of the users that were using the Citi Bikes in NYC, males predominantly were the primary users as evidenced by our chart comparing checkout time by gender. Interestingly enough, while male users significantly outnumbered female users, they both peaked during the same duration of 4-6 hours. 

* The next thing we wanted to look at was when users would most likely use Bike Sharing based on the day of the week and the time of day. There was a clear higher concentration of users on Thursdays at 5-6pm. However, Mondays and Tuesdays from 5-6pm as well as Thursdays at 8-9am also showed a bit more activity. 

* Our next point of analysis was regarding gender and which days and times they were mostly likely to utilize the Citi Bike Sharing services. Since males tended to signficantly out-use females, the gradation of the heatmap of our charts reflected that. Still, from that we can clearly see that Mondays and Tuesdays from 8am-9am and more specifically Thursdays from 5-7pm showed the highest concentration of bike users.

* An interesting aspect of comparing customers (point of contact users) versus subscribers showed that the vast majority of users were in fact male subscribers. Once again, Thursdays demonstrated that the highest concentration of subscribers used Citi Bikes bewteen the hours of 5-7pm. There was not any significant difference between males and females amongst one-time users. 

* Another thing we wanted to look at were popular start and end locations for users. There was a clear uptick in midtown and down towards the West Village for Citi Bike users. This would make sense in our analysis as those areas do tend to attract a lot of tourists (think Times Square). Similarly, the most popular end locations were also in the same vicinities, which would lead us to believe that people that would use Citi Bikes would tend to stay in the same area to sight see in those regions and return the bikes where they had originally gotten them.

* The final thing that we looked at was where the most popular stations were located regarding where the bikes were being taken from. The data would suggest that they were located in the regions that there are many tourist attractions. For example, Broadway and West 60th was a popular station, which makes sense because of its proximity to Lincoln Center. Likewse, 12th and W 40th would also make sense because of how close it is to the heart of Times Square as well as being relatively close (about 6 blocks) from Madison Square Garden. There was also an uptick in areas around SoHo and the West Village, which makes sense as places that tourists would generally want to be in.

## Summary

From our visualizations, it seems very clear that Thursday was the most popular day for using a Citi Bike in New York City. One of the things that makes New York City unique is how relatively easy it is to traverse the city because it was built on a land-limited island. In a city such as Des Moines, while bike sharing can provide easy and accessible transportation, I think an important aspect to take into consideration is climate as well. August tends to be when the oppressive East Coast heat starts to let up, so it would be interesting (and important) to look at the data not only during the cold months, but also when it is extremely hot and humid and to observe how bike usage changes during those times. I think an additional visualization would be how far bike users tend to go from station to station. This would give us more insight as to if users are riding bikes for leisure, exercise or commuting.
